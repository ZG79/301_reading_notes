# Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions to solve problems. In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and stored in variables.
### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects
### What are the benefits of a pure function?
using pure functions can make your code more predictable, testable, reusable, parallelizable, and easier to debug. 
### What is immutability?
An immutable object is one whose state cannot be modified once it is instantiated. Instead, you create a new object with the new value. Mutability is discouraged in functional programming.
### What is Referential transparency?
